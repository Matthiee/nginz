# nginz
A 3D game engine with its own odd style.  
The engine is currently highly unstable and in active development.  

If you try to use it and it suddenly decides to eat your cat, don't blame it on us.  
As Eminem said: With great power comes absolutely no responsibility.

# Technology
nginz is built on top of OpenTK and OpenAL.
